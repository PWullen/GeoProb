# Geometric Prob
A commandline function to generate multiple samples of a geometric probability distribution with pre-defined probabilities given in the prompt 

% A basketball team with 15 players is practicing.  During practice,
% each player attempts to shoot a basket, one after another. The star
% player, Prob Ability, always shoots first. Prob’s shot has a 0.5 success
% probability. Prob is such an inspiration to the rest of the team that if
% their shot is successful, the remaining players do much better following
% it. Specifically, if Prob is successful, each of the other players’ shots
% are successful with probability 0.8, but if Prob is unsuccessful, they
% are only successful with probability 0.2.  After Prob shoots, all the
% other player’s shots are independent.  Once each player shoots once,
% let X be the total number of successful shots (including Prob’s).
